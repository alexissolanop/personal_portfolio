Personal Portfolio Project

This is a project from the Responsive Web Design course in Free Code Camp.

The task is to apply the concepts learned so far: HTML, CSS, Visual Design, Accessibility, and more.

This is part five of five. The project is to create a personal portfolio to showcase my work.
